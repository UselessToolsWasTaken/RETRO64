# #RETRO64
#RETRO64 or just #R64 for short is a programming language designed to maintain a constrained environment with a syntax close to human readable ASM while also feeling like you're in your basement in 1985 writing some sick scripts. 

### Python
Currently the language is written and compiled with Python. And while that's fine as a proof of concept kind of deal it's not the main thing.

### C
The next step is to port the entire prototype to C and expand on what has been defined already and make #RETRO64 Feel super viby.

# Why #RETRO64? Why should you use it?
For fun. I made the langauge as a "i can so I will" and "Everything right now is screaming at me, I need a space to just chill out and vibe". I want to share this idea that you don't have to dive into any C syntax or Python or whatever and drown in all their ability and functionality... You can just, run #RETRO64 which will compile natively into binaries when I'm done with that, run it on your system and it'll do things. And it will have you work for it doing things in a fun way. Minimal abstraction, limited memory allocation per file, single file programs, no libraries, no imports, no bullshit, all on you.
